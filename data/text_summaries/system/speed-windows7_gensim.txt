My system seems to be faster, all of my previous programs and peripherals run without a problem, things come up quicker when clicking on them and I love the new look .
Some of the things I like most about Windows 7 is how fast it boots up and shuts off .
I can finally use adobe CS4, before with Vista 32bit photoshop cs4 wouldn't run so smoothly as cs3 but now it opens faster and is just working great .
It boots faster, the programs run faster and the overall performance has been nothing short of amazing .
Based on speed and performance, it does deliver for it is pretty fast when opening programs, boot time, hibernation, etc .
Very robust and extremely fast, I can find and open programs or files by just hitting  window  on the keyboard   and typing in the first few letters of the thing I want to open and Win7 almost instantaneously finds what I'm looking for .
