1 inch screens, Windows XP operating systems, a plethora of USB ports, a card reader, WiFi and most have a few color choices . Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop . The battery life is unbelievable, even while using USB to transfer files, watching movies and surfing the internet with screen brightness all the way up . I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness . you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .
