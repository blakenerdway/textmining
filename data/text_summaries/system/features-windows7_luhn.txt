Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features . I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files . 0 out of 5 stars XP speed & stability, Vista, like features without the headaches ! And I love all the new Aero Shake Peek Snap windows features, but I still prefer Mac OS X's Expose . A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .
