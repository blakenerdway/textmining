went for a city break with the family hotel good location harrods 20 mins walk,royal albert hall 10 mins,and under ground around the corner,plenty to see and do around hotel . It's a great location   ,  literally a minute's walk to Gloucester Road tube station, 5 mins walk to the Victoria   Albert Museum and the British Science Museum . Great location ,  a couple of minutes walk from Gloucester Rd underground station, and shops, restaurants, internet cafe etc Great location but don't bring the car ! brilliant, behind tube station, near local stores, restaurant, posh area, near kensington park, great central location yet quiet enough in a cul, de, sac location . Like others, I liked the location with restaurants, Glouster tube station, small grocery stores, , , and internet cafes within easy walking distance .
