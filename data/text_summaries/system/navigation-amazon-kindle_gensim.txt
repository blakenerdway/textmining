On the Kindle, you have wireless delivery, easy navigation, no ads, no need to flip to page D17 and find the place where you left off .
Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .
3 Easy page turns and navigation .
The screen reads like paper, it is easy to navigate .
I find myself reading faster, because the text is more readable for me, and the navigation through the book is so very easy .
I really enjoy the menu button and the 5, way controller to navigate .
