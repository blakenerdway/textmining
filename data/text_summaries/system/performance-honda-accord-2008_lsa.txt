For the record I test, drove the Lexus350 the BMW 5 series, the infiniti G35 and enjoyed the Honda performance equally for far less money ! I researched many other makes and models but for the performance, quality, and style, the accord won hands down for cars under $32,000 . Overweight ,  3600 pounds, lots of road noise, and the combined performance of the VCM and the grade logic automatic transmission mke this a miserable driver . After tracking almost 2 months of research on American and Japanese mid, size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety ,  Honda Accord and Toyota Camry . My my, I have never experienced such smooth performance, stability, pick, up, mileage and comfort that I am enjoying with my new 2008 Honda Accord .
