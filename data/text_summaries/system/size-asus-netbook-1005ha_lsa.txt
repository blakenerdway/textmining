Yes, I did have an airplane trip in the last couple of days, and was thankful for the small size when the person in front of me reclined their seat back all the way for the whole flight . I had some real problems trying to use my Toshiba Satellite when flying for the past few years, and the distance between the top of the display and the edge of the netbook when open is a practical size to get my work done on a flight . It runs quietly and operates Windows efficiently, staying incredibly cool compared to the instant burn, your, lap sauna of my full, sized HP Pavillion . The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   . Because of its size and ease of travel ,  pretty soon this became an important part of my wife's professional life and she was using it for work, business discussions, document development etc .
