The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models . I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me . easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map . The sound isn't that bad, Just make sure you get your free map update from the Garmin site within the 60 day time period . Not so ,  tried the Garmin web site for an updated map and was told by Garmin that none was available .
