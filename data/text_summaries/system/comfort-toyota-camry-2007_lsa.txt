great ride, quiet comfortable spacious cabin, superior electronics  , fair price and good looks . The sound system is incredible, the seats are comfortable, the controls are ergonomic and straight forward and the take off power is quite impressive . I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has . It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road . I only have a vibration shimmy problem at 70 mph, visited dealer three times and ended up with changing a new tire and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .
