The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .
Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .
The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .
It has a lot of good features ,  including a speedometer, posted speed limits on major roads, and it notes your average and max speed on your current trip .
I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !
Shows the speed limits on the major roads !
