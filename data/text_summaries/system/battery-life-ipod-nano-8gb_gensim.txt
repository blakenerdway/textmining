scratches easily, short battery life  I purchased this for my 6 year old son and he LOVES IT !
It is easy to use and has great battery life .
the battery life  this was an awsome christmas present and i love it its really easy to use and sounds great .
this is my first ipod and its awsome the only thing i dont like is the battery life it lasts all day if you dont use it a lot but if you use it constantly like i do it only last about 4 or 5 hours not a big deal though .
SHORT BATTERY LIFE,SCRATCHES EASY,  I DONT LIKE THE APPLES LIBRARY .
Battery life seems to be good .
