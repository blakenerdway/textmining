I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .
First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .
The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .
A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .
I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .
The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .
The voice is clear and easy to understand .
Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .
