This car is nearly perfect when compared to other cars in this class regarding interior dimensions, visibility, exterior styling, etc . The interior looks good but feels cheap compared to my 1997 LE camry . The exterior and interior are nice . Interior exterior quality is very good . Nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .
