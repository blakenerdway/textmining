Nice looking car and good gas mileage . The gas mileage has been getting better . Would like to see better gas mileage too . Great performance, great gas mileage  , superior quality ,  I always thought of a Camry as just a practical family sedan . Gas mileage is 28 mpg on combined and 32 when we were on trip of 100 miles .
