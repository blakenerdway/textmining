Free Wifi in your room, and the free wine reception in the evenings was great . At 5 o'clock every evening in the hotel lobby there is a free wine reception for an hour . Another great thing about the hotel is that every day, they offer wine and beer from 5, 6pm for free for all hotel guests . Free coffee in the lobby in the mornings is nice . Morning coffee and biscotti was a nice touch as well as the all you can drink free wine hour in the evening .
