Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed . The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area . Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom . Shows the speed limits on the major roads ! What I like most about the 255W is that it shows the road's speed limit right above your actual speed, which I find most helpful, since, again, I use it mostly in areas where I'm not familiar with the roads and local speed limits .
