What's more, it's easy to change font size . I know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought . I have changed the font size so that it is so easy to see . 1All the fonts look exactly the same, regardless of the book . Easy on the eyes, font size can be changed and the book will even read to you if you want it too !
