Great rooms  great staff  great hotel The hotel had nIce, well, decorated, fairly, modern rooms . The hotel is pretty much as you'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well serviced, and the staff were extremely helpful,  very pleasant to deal with . Upon arriving late through no fault of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again Rooms good, decor very well done in Italian style Tuscan ! It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour . The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .
