I was an avid reader but increasing age has made printed books more of a challenge, but the Kindle with its varying font size and very light weight has made reading fun again .
Downloading books is easy, the screen is NOT too dark, the font size is adjustable and the Kindle customer service support is terrific .
I know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought .
Easy on the eyes, font size can be changed and the book will even read to you if you want it too !
Because of the ability to change the font size on the KINDLE she was able to once again start reading a book .
it's just like reading a paper book, but BETTER because you can increase the font size !
