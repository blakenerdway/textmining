Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead . This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo . The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen . All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time . The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .
