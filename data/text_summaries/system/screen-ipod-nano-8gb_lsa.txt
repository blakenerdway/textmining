video, motion sensing, screen size and sllek look  I recently upgraded from the 2nd generation Nano and love the new features of the newest model . What's more, even if I cut a long essay into chips with 5k binary limit for each one, some of them may still be unreadable through the note reader since the wheel just simply doesn't work out to scroll the screen down . The only negative thing I would say is that I cannot find a sleeve coverwith a belt clip like I had for my 2nd gen, it was neoprene and protected the screen and thumb wheel . Very easy to use, love the pedometer, lightweight, thin, nice screen, great sound, battery lasts much longer than stated  . Video is impressive, speaker sound is good for size, easy menus, screen is big enough to watch movies .
