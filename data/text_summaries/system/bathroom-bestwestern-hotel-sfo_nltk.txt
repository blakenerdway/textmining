  The room was not overly big, but clean and very comfortable beds, a great shower and very clean bathrooms . Also, the bathrooms were quite well set up, with a seperate toilet shower to basin, so whilst one guest is showering another can use the basin . The room was wonderful with great beds, a nice bathroom and we also had an excellent view of Coit Tower as well . The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to . The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good . The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it . Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up . Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly . The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .
