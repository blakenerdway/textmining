The interior looks good but feels cheap compared to my 1997 LE camry .
I love its Avalon like roomy interior and great looks .
Like the looks and styling, both interior and exterior .
The styling does not say  Camry  anymore and the interior is mostly excellent ,  door handles are too hard and plasticky, some rattles especially when cold outside, not overly fond of the center console design .
I bought this car smitten by its exterior look and interior comfort .
The ride is quieter, the car faster, the exterior and interior looks better .
The interior is nice and roomy and the exterior design is beautiful .
The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .
Nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .
The plastic interior looks and feels cheap .
