It cost me thousands of dollars to get rid of it, but the seats gave me and my wife back pain after 20 minutes of driving ! However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle . The black leather seats feel a bit hot on the back in the warm weather but otherwise no complaints about the interior . Also, amazing leg space in front AND back seats ,  the Accord could almost be considered a full size sedan . The satellite radio cuts out constantly, the heated seats are barely warm, the sound system is pathetic and the brakes wore out around 15,000 miles google it .
