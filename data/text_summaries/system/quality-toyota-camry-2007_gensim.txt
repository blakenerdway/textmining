This car looks great and the build quality is good .
Mine suffers from the tranny slip   on the 3, 4 upshift when cold, build quality is good but nothing like the Toyota, hype I was expecting, as it has its share of squeaks and rattles just like a 10 year old Chevy .
Overall a good car, no build quality issues yet .
It has high quality amazing ride and the fit and finish is great .
This was the 7th Camry and the last, I feel Toyota quality is slipping big time .
The ride, the fit and the build quality are what I was expecting after owning Toyotas in the past .
Excellent interior build quality .
