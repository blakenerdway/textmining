Mine suffers from the tranny slip   on the 3, 4 upshift when cold, build quality is good but nothing like the Toyota, hype I was expecting, as it has its share of squeaks and rattles just like a 10 year old Chevy . Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily . I have rattles on both B pillars and the build quality is rather poor, with unsightly gaps in the passenger side dash where it does not fit together properly . Vehicle ride is extremely smooth, compliant and quiet ,  very close to Lexus quality   for thousands of dollars less . I love the car's visual and aesthetic design, but quality is just as important and for that reason, I would NOT recommend the new Camry to anyone !
