Coffee and biscotti were available in reception every morning free of charge or if you preferred, there was a restaurant in the hotel that served breakfast or a Starbucks round the corner . The wine tasting in the afternoon made available from the manager was a really nice touch as was the free tea and coffee in the lobby in the morning which got you off to a great start for the day . We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   . A complete disappointment ,  from losing the reservation made through Best Western toll, free number   to charging our credit card for someone elses stay 3 WEEKS AFTER WE LEFT ! The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .
