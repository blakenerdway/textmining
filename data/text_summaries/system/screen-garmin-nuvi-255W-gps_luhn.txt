Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom . I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen . The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display . The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen . The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .
