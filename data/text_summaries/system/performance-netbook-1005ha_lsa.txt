One word of advice is to be really careful about which anti, malware software you install since it will degrade performance both on and off the internet on these netbooks . Just some advice ,  use Eset's anti, virus and not Norton, McAfee, CA or the like ,  if not you will loose a lot in performance . The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   . My desktop is a very strong dual, core computer running windows 7 and I cant see a performance decrease doing everyday things on the netbook . I spent a bit of time researching the various netbooks currently available and thought that the 1005HA, P had a nice mix of style, battery life, ergonomics, and performance   .
