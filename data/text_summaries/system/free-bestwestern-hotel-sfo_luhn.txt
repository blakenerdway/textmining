The wine reception is a great idea as it is nice to meet other travellers and great having access to the free Internet access in our room . This hotel offers a lot ,  a great location, great staff, free wine tastings and morning coffee . The hotel had free coffee and drinks everyday and free access to wireless internet . The free wine beer and coffee hot chocolate biscotti is a wonderful touch and we took full advantage of it . Evening wine hour from 5, 6 was also good , free wine and nibbles and a chance to talk to other guests about places to visit , eat etc .
