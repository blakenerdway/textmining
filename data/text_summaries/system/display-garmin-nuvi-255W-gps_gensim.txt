The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .
The widescreen display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the screen, , which makes it much easier to differentiate between which road to turn on when there are two streets on your right   that are only one house apart .
Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .
The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .
One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .
