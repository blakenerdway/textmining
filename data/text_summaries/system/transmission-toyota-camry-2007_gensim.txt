I've had the same transmission problems hesitation issues as everyone else .
The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .
decent power for a 4 cylinder, but a dangerous hesitating transmission that toyota does not seem to want acknowledge or fix .
The transmission shifts smooth at all speeds .
After driving my car almost 20,000 miles I have grown disappointed with the transmission hesitation problem as it did not show during the test drive .
Toyota now has a fix for the accelerator hesitation and transmission problem !
I hate the transmission as it always hesitates to downshift when the power and speed is needed .
No transmission flares, hesitations, rattles or any other problems .
Quiet and refined ride, 4 cyl has sufficient power for everyday driving, and a smooth transmission that shifts well .
I have had issues with the new 6 speed transmission, there is a  shift flare  between 3rd and 4th gear with my car .
The six speed auto transmission is very smooth .
Due to lack, of, power or transmission problem, car down, shifts revs to 3000
Power is great, transmission shifts are smooth and accurate .
268 HP V6 with 6 speed auto transmission is very responsive and smooth .
The 5 speed transmission shifts like one would with a manual .
