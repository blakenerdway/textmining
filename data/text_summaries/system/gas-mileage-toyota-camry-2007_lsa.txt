Being a mother who drives a lot I wanted a safe vehicle with good gas mileage and this car delivered that and more . hesitating then surge between shifts, windshield wipers that move with power that rocks the car to the point that it feels like it will roll over, plastic parts falling off, cruise control is so unreliable I don't use it, bad mileage, and, last but not least, half the windshild blacks out when driving at night through areas without street lights . It gets great mileage for a V6, good sound system that comes standard in all Camrys and overall styling looks sporty and aggressive . Gas mileage for us will be what it is rated, maybe a little better on highway on the flat open roads of West Texas if you don't put your foot in it all the time . Poor mileage is yet another factor as is the numerous blind spots resulting from the appearance over proper design issues .
