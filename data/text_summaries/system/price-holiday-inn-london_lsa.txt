If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here . Would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price I got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the touristy sites in London . ,  smallish roomsOld style bar pubNo ventilation on a smoking floorIt's not worth the hotel web, site price of £160 for STD room . We've stayed in London a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults . My friend and I had one pancakes and syrup, two orange juices, one tea, and one smoked salmon and scrambled egg with english muffin for £8   in total ,  the same price as one discounted breakfast at the hotel !
