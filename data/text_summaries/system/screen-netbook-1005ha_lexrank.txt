The screen is small, only 1024 x 600 . The shiny screen is reflective, which can be a problem if you have your back to a sunny window or work outdoors . I usually run IE8 in full screen mode   with a 95% zoom setting and a 1024x600 resolution . The screen size works just fine for me . The screen resolution can be a little small at times, but that is a sacrifice I was willing to make .
