I wouldn't say it stands out particularly, but if you're looking for a reliable, convenient, comfortable place in London, this is a great place to stay , ,  especially if you can get it at a good price on Priceline or another site like that .
Would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price I got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the touristy sites in London .
Staff very friendly and I always worry when booking through priceline that I will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .
We've stayed in London a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .
Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying Â£17 more per night than I'd expected .
Also got a good price for the room thro priceline about 47 pounds per night, hotel very clean and well run .
Location is great, hotel is wonderful, and price is right, it really is hard to beat right now .
hotel but would stay again if the price was right due to the excellent location .
good hotel for the price and location .
Good Price Great Location Would definately stay there again !
For a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service .
All in all I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a pleasant stay in London, in a nice area, at a good price !
One of the better places I've stayed in London for the price .
Great room fabulous price wonderful location !
