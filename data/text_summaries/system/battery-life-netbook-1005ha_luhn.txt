5 Hour Battery, Glossy Display, Bluetooth, Netbook Sleeve 5 Hour Battery, Matted Display 5 Hour Battery, Matted Display After you add sales tax, you are then approaching the price of the V series which gets twice the battery life . The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat . If someone is in the market for a great little traveling machine to access the internet, send receive emails, do some writing, and need extended battery life, I highly recommend this Asus eee netbook . The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   . After 3 hrs the battery was fully charged, unplugged the netbook, started up Windows, and the battery indicator showed about 10 hours charge remaining .
