You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing . More likely, by the time the battery no longer holds a charge, there will be a K7 with a color screen and 200 times the memory that I'll want to upgrade to ! So far, the battery charge seems to last quite a long time for reading . I leave the wireless access feature turned off for longer battery life . Plus the Kindle 2's Battery life is 4 days longer per charge .
