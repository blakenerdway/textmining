Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again . It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books . About a month ago after finishing in one weekend and realizing that I paid $28 for it I thought Kindle's cheaper prices and mobility would be great . I can download samples and buy books for $10 so I have a lot of things I would not buy if I had to pay full price . I would love a case cover that's well made and doesn't cost a third the price of the device .
