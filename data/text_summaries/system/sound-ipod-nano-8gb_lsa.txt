The iPod Nano is a very sleek, cutting edge device with high, quality sound and state, of, the, art graphics . Only things I wish they added is measuring distance [not just steps] on the pedometer, better sound on the speaker, and a  capturing still images  with the video recording feature . Very easy to use, love the pedometer, lightweight, thin, nice screen, great sound, battery lasts much longer than stated  . Video is impressive, speaker sound is good for size, easy menus, screen is big enough to watch movies . Long Battery Life, Sleek Compact, Easy To Set Up, Reliable Performance, Great Sound, Lots of Storage bought it for the gym and it was just the right weight !
