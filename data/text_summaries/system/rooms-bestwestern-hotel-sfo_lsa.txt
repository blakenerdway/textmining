The location was perfect for perusing the shops at Fishermans Wharf, we had dinner at Nicks's Lighthouse ,  the food was fine but the rest rooms were in a horrendous state, which completely put us off . Yes, the rooms aren't that big, but after deciding that our main goal was to find a nice clean hotel close to Fisherman's wharf and near a lot of the public transportation, it was a perfect choice for us . In our opinion, a bit of faux Italian décor, some nice throw pillows on the bed and smaller than average rooms doesn’t really stretch to “European, style Boutique Hotel” . Boudin Bakery an excellent nearby option for breakfast lunch and with Trader Joes right next door you should not need to avail yourself of the very expensive mini bar in the rooms . It is in a great location, the staff is always alert and courteous, the rooms are clean, the morning coffee and biscotti are a nice touch, the happy hour is a PLUS, and the price is right  !
