The bedroom, although recently upgraded with a new bed   had wall paper that was unstuck at the seams throughout the room and the rest of the furniture appeared the quality of a budget hotel brand ,  the TV was an outdated model . OK, the rooms are a bit on the small side, and it's a tad noisy generally of an evening, but what do you expect from a large hotel slap bang in the middle of one of the main arterial routes into London ? The room was as expected for a Holiday Inn, cute little fridge with lots of goodies, a teapot, comfortable beds, clean, neatly renovated bathroom, plenty of hot water, overall pleasant . good size considered it is in london, comfy double bed, clean in room, tea coffee choc making facilities, hairdryer under desk, old tv, toilet facilities was disgusting, long curly black hair in bathtub, big black pubic hair tangled in hand towel, disgusting yellow scum stick on toilet seat, dove shampoo bottle near bathtub and dove cream cleanser bottle near hand basic were both empty, cheap plastic canteen cups on wash basin, only one tiny hand soap, NO supply of essential basic vanity kits   only available if ask, cheap standard chain hotel decor, room was quiet, did not hear anything from the street, but doors closed loudly from nearby rooms on the corridor . When we stepped into the room it was an even greater relief, on the 17th floor we had a wonderful view of Earlâ€™s Court and some Georgian architecture, our favorite visual was an advertisement against smoking, in which there was a cigarette half un, wrapped with what appeared to be a fatty clogged artery inside .
