This tuscan, themed hotel was charming, clean   comfortable and the complimentary concierge service was so helpful .
Excellent service great location good value
Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .
We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .
The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .
very good hotel ,  great location, concierge extremely helpful, decor is nice and the maid service was excellent   .
service was extra good, very friendly and there is a great cafe across the street   which has the best breakfast in the world .
Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again .
The hotel is pretty much as you'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well serviced, and the staff were extremely helpful,  very pleasant to deal with .
The hotel room was average although the service was good .
It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour .
Very clean room, great location, wonderful service and dog friendly .
I had breakfast and dinner a few times at the restaurant joined to the hotel, Cafe Pescatore, and thought the food and the service were both very good .
The service is always great and the rooms very clean .
