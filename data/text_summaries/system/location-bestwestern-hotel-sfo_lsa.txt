Location of the hotel was ideal to explore the know attractions, with just a 2 min walk to the wharf   ferries and the famous cable cars, which transported you to union square  lombard st etc . This hotel can trade on its location which, although a rather ugly and unappealing area full of tacky tourist shops, predictable chain restaurants and large number of tour groups, is an excellent base to explore the city . The location is great since it is only a couple blocks to Fisherman's Wharf, the ferry for Alcatraz, Pier 39, Ghiradelli Square, cable cars, bus stops, and there is a small shopping center across the street with grocery store, etc . All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over . Great room, friendly staff, superb location ,  just a couple of blocks away from the hustle and bustle of Fisherman's Wharf and 2 minutes from the cable car turnaround that takes you straight to Union Square .
