It is easy to read and when touching the screen it works great !
Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .
The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .
The screen is very bright and easy to see with direct sunlight and at night time .
The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .
Functionally the only slight problem is that on my unit I have to press pretty hard on the screen if I want to 'drag' the map .
The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .
The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .
We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .
3 wide screen also   speak out the streets name and tells you when or how far to turn
