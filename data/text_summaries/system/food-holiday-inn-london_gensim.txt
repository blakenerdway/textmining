There are a couple pubs, a great patisserie and even fast food restaurants within a block .
The neighborhood is an upscale residential area full of restaurants in easy walking distance ranging from  fast food  to up, scale with a wide variety of cuisines , ,  we never had a bad meal .
The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .
We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .
The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a Waitrose , Tesco and various Fast Food joints and restaurants nearby .
The hotel itself was very pleasant ,  the staff friendly and helpful and I can only comment on the breakfasts as this was the only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .
The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .
Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !
The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .
Additionally, they recommended the Cafe Forum which was about two blocks from the hotel for breakfast, the prices were reasonable and food was excellent .
There was also a more expensive English breakfast with many hot foods which was included in some room prices .
