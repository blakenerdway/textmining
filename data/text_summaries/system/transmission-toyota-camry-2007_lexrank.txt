I've had the same transmission problems hesitation issues as everyone else . The transmission shifts smooth at all speeds . Toyota now has a fix for the accelerator hesitation and transmission problem ! I have had issues with the new 6 speed transmission, there is a  shift flare  between 3rd and 4th gear with my car . The 5 speed transmission shifts like one would with a manual .
