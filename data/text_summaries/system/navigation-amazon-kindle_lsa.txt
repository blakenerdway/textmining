This is a beautiful little product  it feels sleek and sturdy and   booklike in my hands, the controls are finally where they ought to be and the navigation interface is intuitive and easy to learn . As mentioned above, the free copies also do not have active table of contents, so navigation is well near impossible beyond simply ploughing through form start to finish, which is what I did . I think in most areas the Kindle 2 has met expectations, but a sluggish cursor, poor navigation and almost non, existent capability to organize content are major drawbacks . The buttons work well even with my large fingers and the navigating 5, position control is easily mastered and easy to use effectively . I found the Kindle Store to be full featured and easy to navigate, and was impressed that you even have the ability to write book reviews directly from the device .
