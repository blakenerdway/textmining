Although it is fun to drive and quality seems ok, the leather seats are very uncomfortable, especially on a long drive .
The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats .
Leather seats are the only thing of good quality .
You get a V, 6, heated leather seats, XM, 18  rims .
Don't get me wrong, the Accord is a comfortable car, I am just a big guy and the seats just feel like they could use a little more of something .
Leather seats are very comfortable .
Front seats much more comfortable .
Seats are too firm and leather is quite  hard  in character and feel .
