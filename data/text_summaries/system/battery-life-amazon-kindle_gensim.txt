After 1 year you pay $80 plus shipping to send the device to Amazon and have the Kindle REPLACED, not the battery changed out   .
Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .
Short battery life ,  I charged this thing for a couple of hours, 24 hours ago ,  it's still running and just at 75% of full power .
very thin, light, weight, and attractive, looking with more data storage and faster battery charges with longer usage compared to Kindle 1,
More likely, by the time the battery no longer holds a charge, there will be a K7 with a color screen and 200 times the memory that I'll want to upgrade to !
I leave the wireless access feature turned off for longer battery life .
With 2, 3 hours of reading per day, my Kindle battery has lasted me only 4 days .
Plus the Kindle 2's Battery life is 4 days longer per charge .
I just found out how to save the battery and you can read for well over a week without a charge .
