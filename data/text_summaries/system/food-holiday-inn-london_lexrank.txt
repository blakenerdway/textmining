,  Great location  ,  Very good selection of food for breakfast buffet . The food is excellent and the service great . Additionally, they recommended the Cafe Forum which was about two blocks from the hotel for breakfast, the prices were reasonable and food was excellent . The food was good and the service was very good . There was also a more expensive English breakfast with many hot foods which was included in some room prices .
