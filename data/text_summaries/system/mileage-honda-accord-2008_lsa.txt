The 4,  door provides the room we needed, the exterior design keeps the  sedan  from looking boring, the gas mileage is great, the price point was right, and the reliability is terrific . i just purchased my lx, p a couple of weeks ago, having driven a pick up for the last 25 years, i was really surprised at how much i like this car, going from a big v, 8 to a 4 is a change but the power is good, gas mileage is great . 5L V6 scoots  sporty handling and acceleration good  sporty leather seats  highway gas mileage  appearance package worth having  no dealer service yet  Negatives : Tough negotiations w 6 Wash DC dealers  city gas mileage  road noise  no keyless memory link w driver profiles  steering wheel quality and size  console storage tray  outside mirrors don ? I love the appearance of the car from the outside, and it has a much bigger feel to it, ride is a little stiff but smooth, engine is very responsive, however gas mileage is diappointing getting 5 mpg less then 06 Accord .
