Although it is fun to drive and quality seems ok, the leather seats are very uncomfortable, especially on a long drive . The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats . Ride is very good, but seats are just a little firm . Leather seats are very comfortable . Front seats much more comfortable .
