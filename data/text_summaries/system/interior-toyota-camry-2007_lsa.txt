The styling does not say  Camry  anymore and the interior is mostly excellent ,  door handles are too hard and plasticky, some rattles especially when cold outside, not overly fond of the center console design . After driving it a few days, the interior squeaking and rubbing noises increased so much that I drove to Toyota and had the body shop manager check to see if it had been in a major accident . Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily . It shifts hard, has a lot of play in steering, has quite a few blind spots & the interior is cheap plastic which scratches very easy . The first one was returned to the dealer, on the day of delivery, because of excessive rattling noises coming from the interior, especially the back right side of the car .
