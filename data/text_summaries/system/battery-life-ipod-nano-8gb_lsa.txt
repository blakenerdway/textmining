shortened battery life, not kind to beginners  this ipod is a great new item with a camera and built in speaker . shoes if using vid cam for long time, it kills battery  Standard Def video recording, but still sharp ! battery life, becuase of all the features  I had an apple ipod 3rd generation and the 5th genteration is twice as good as the numbering would suggest . Very easy to use, love the pedometer, lightweight, thin, nice screen, great sound, battery lasts much longer than stated  . Long Battery Life, Sleek Compact, Easy To Set Up, Reliable Performance, Great Sound, Lots of Storage bought it for the gym and it was just the right weight !
