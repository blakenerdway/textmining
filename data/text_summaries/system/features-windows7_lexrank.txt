But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers . Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features . LEAST useful features of Windows 7 to me : They're features I don't use . There are many features that allow me to personalize my working environment . Vista has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .
