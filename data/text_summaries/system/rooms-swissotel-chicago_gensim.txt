The Swissotel is one of our favorite hotels in Chicago and the corner rooms have the most fantastic views in the city .
My son loved the Chicago river view from our 31st floor , rooms where neat and clean .
The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and local bars restaurants on the golden mile, and views from most rooms very good .
The ideal location   coupled with great service and beautiful rooms makes for a wonder stay .
Rooms are good quality and clean, what you would expect from a four star business hotel .
Great Location Nice Rooms Loved the Swissotel !
very nice pool and spa on the 42nd floor, rooms and lobby were clean, easy walk to Michigan Ave through via the lower level walkway to the Illinois State center, beds were comfortable .
The actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views, the staff was extremely rude .
Our family of 4 frequents Chicago and oftentime forgoes the comfort of a more spacious suite just to experience the thrill of the view of the river and Navy Pier that Swissotel's Lakeview rooms provide .
Rooms were clean, good sized and great views of Navy Pier .
