The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .

I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .
This netbook is just the right size, great for travel and the 10 .
