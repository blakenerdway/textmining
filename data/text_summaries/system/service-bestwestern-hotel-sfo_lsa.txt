Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   . We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service . Will store your luggage in separate room on your check out day if you have late flight, want to spend more time,Oldest Italian restaurant in the country w in walking distance, back east service, integrity, etc . The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning . i would also urge other vistors to prebook Alacatraz with Blue and Gold Fleet direct on there website before they arrive in San Fran as you can pick up your tickets at the self service machine without the miles of queues !
