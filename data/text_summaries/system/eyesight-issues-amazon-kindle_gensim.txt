'Easy, on, the, eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink :
I can read technical books without any problems but I cannot read text on the Kindle without straining my eyes .
I know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought .
And with the Kindle, I can adjust the font to any of six different sizes, which is of some importance to those with poor vision or tired eyes .
And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !
A backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .
Easy on the eyes, font size can be changed and the book will even read to you if you want it too !
8 E, Ink display is easy to read and doesn't strain your eyes and reads better than a printed page .
