As far as food, walk a few blocks toward Michigan Ave turn left or right and there are plently of less expensive places to eat . A nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food . My only complaint is the Palm restaurant, it is expensive and the food not very good . I had a great experience here from the quality of the lobby, to the quality of the room, to the view, to the room service, to the food . Food unexceptional although the breakfast buffet in the basement restaurant   was of good quality .
