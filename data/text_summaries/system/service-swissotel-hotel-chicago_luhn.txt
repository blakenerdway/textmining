The ideal location   coupled with great service and beautiful rooms makes for a wonder stay . 3 We had an Executive Room which granted us access to the 42nd floor Executive Lounge with day, round complimentary beverage service   and pastries, and free Internet Access . Service at the front desk was very friendly and efficient while room, service breakfasts were quite good and delivered promptly . The staff was absolutely excellent = full service, from front desk, to health club attendants, to business center personnel . Swissotel offered all the services extras I like , ,  lots of cabs, in, hotel bar, great views, room service, etc .
