This tuscan, themed hotel was charming, clean   comfortable and the complimentary concierge service was so helpful . We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service . very good hotel ,  great location, concierge extremely helpful, decor is nice and the maid service was excellent   . In accordance with the Tuscan Innâ€™s Italian style theme a coffee tea biscotti service was open from 6am till 9am in the mornings . It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour .
