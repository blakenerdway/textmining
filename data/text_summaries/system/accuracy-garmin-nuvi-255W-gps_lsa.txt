This function is not accurate if you don't leave it in battery mode say, when you stop at the Cracker Barrell for lunch and to play one of those trangle games with the tees . Because the accuracy is good to the street address level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall . I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate . I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination . Very easy to operate and pretty accurate as well, only led me astray once and that was in northern Maine where roads are few and paved ones fewer .
