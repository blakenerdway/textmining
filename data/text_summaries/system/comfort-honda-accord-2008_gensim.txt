Drivers seat not comfortable, the car itself compared to other models of similar class .
Although not the fastest, most luxurious, or technologically advanced in the very competitive mid, size sedan segment, the Accord strikes the perfect balance of sport, comfort and value, creating a vehicle that feels and acts like a much pricier machine .
The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats .
I would recommend this car for great value, comfort, & fun to drive !
Absolutely got a great car, roomy, comfortable, great ride for a nice price .

A little pricy but it's really a comfortable car and a great driving machine .
The car is roomy inside, comfortable, handles and performs great and is fun to drive .
Don't get me wrong, the Accord is a comfortable car, I am just a big guy and the seats just feel like they could use a little more of something .
Although it's a lower trim level, it has high quality interior trim  very comfortable seats  and and very smooth, quiet ride .
Leather seats are very comfortable .
Front seats much more comfortable .
The driver, side seat is not comfortable .
Driver seat could be more comfortable however, but I love everything about it .
