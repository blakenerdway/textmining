Overall a good car, no build quality issues yet . This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage JBL radio is low quality cd, fm, and mp3 all sound the same . Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily . transmission hunts for gears, ride quality much worse than even a mediocre car, Auto sound level doesn't work, accessory outlets do not work unless car is running or acc is on  , radio shuts off when engine is shut off . While I love the design, the poor components, sub, par fit, and, finish, poor quality control, and unreliable work on the part of dealership techs will make me question the quality of any future Toyota vehicle .
