I expect to get 6, 7 hours in high performance mode . I have the Super Hybrid Engine set to auto mode, which I'm guessing is less than High or Super Performance   . The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   . It freaked me out since I wasn't running anything high performance . 0 out of 5 stars Good ergonomics, exceptional battery, performance meets expectations .
