Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   . The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good . The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward . It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly . The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .
