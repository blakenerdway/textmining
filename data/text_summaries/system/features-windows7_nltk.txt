 But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment . If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that . Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features . Windows 7 Ultimate is there too off course, but I personally can't bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker . Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements . I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files . I really wanted to like Vista with all it's cool new features, but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didn't work . And I love all the new Aero Shake Peek Snap windows features, but I still prefer Mac OS X's Expose . ,  New features with better window and file managment
,  Many features are copied from Mac OS X
 Of course there are some new features, and a little more eye candy if that's important to you too . Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .
