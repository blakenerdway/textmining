The hotel staff was consistently friendly and helpful throughout our stay, especially Cliff, the consierge, providing directions, maps, dinner recommendations and reservations, and suggestions for sightseeing . Upon arriving late through no fault of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again Staff very helpful and pleasant . There appears to be no management actively involved with running this dump, cause when we asked to speak with one the front desk staff got very nervous and suddenly worked hard to find our lost reservation . Great room, friendly staff, superb location ,  just a couple of blocks away from the hustle and bustle of Fisherman's Wharf and 2 minutes from the cable car turnaround that takes you straight to Union Square . My final thought ,  1 recurring image during this week   was the staff demonstarations outside a number of prominent hotels , many were day long vigils and many were noisy ,  the good news was that the Tuscan was not 1 of them  !
