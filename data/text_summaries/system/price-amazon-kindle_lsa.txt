To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant . The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless . But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price . About a month ago after finishing in one weekend and realizing that I paid $28 for it I thought Kindle's cheaper prices and mobility would be great . Reading is something that I absolutely love, but I find it hard to wait several days for a book to be shipped to me or pay the outrageous prices at a bookstore .
