Pro's ,  I so wanted to love the small size, long battery life, brilliant blue color and light weight . Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on . I originally bought the EEE to take with me whenever my laptop was too big to take somewhere, but have started exclusively using the EEE in place of my laptop because of its portability and battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops . The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   . The battery life is to die for ,  my full size laptop doesnt have 10 Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .
