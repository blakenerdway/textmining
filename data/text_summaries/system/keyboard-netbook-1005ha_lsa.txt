I found if I pushed down and slid upward in the upper left corner, the keyboard moved up slightly and clicked into place . It is a bit of a pain to unplug and replug power, monitor, LAN, wireless mouse keyboard, hard drive back, up and PDA cable, but not the end of the world . Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point . Has a very long battery life, runs videos and multimedia smoothly without issues, fast loading, very usable keyboard, stylish sleek design, decent pricing for what you get Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard . A lot of netbooks on the market have mangled the keyboard in one way or another such that if you are a touch typist, you find yourself hitting the wrong key often, which is frustrating .
