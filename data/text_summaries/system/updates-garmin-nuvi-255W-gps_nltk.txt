 Upon plugging my Nuvi 255w in the PC for the first time, it immediately informed me of both a software update and a map update . I have Comcast cable Internet and a quad, core PC with 4gb of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install . I have held off from getting any GPS unit for a long time because I have a book of maps for the United States and I have always been able to update the travel  atlas  and supplement that with free maps from the internet via Google, Yahoo, etc . _________________________ UPDATE__________________________
 With the TomTom, if you update to the newest map firmware you get everything the Garmin 765 has minus the traffic . However, the points of interests are substandard, it would not pick up restuarants that we know have been there >3 yrs, and that was after we updated the maps, which was a 3 hr download . I found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden . Once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days . ,  Updating the GPS took way to long and I have DSL ,  4 hours to download a 2GB map update and 3 hours to install the program to the GPS . The sound isn't that bad, Just make sure you get your free map update from the Garmin site within the 60 day time period . Not so ,  tried the Garmin web site for an updated map and was told by Garmin that none was available . in a  test  the day I received the unit, before map updates, I was directed to exit the freeway many miles before it made sense .
