'Easy, on, the, eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink : I noticed this almost immediately but thought it was due to my poor eyesight . Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows . A backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book . 8 E, Ink display is easy to read and doesn't strain your eyes and reads better than a printed page . The screen is easy on the eyes, easy to learn, easy to turn pages, and the device is more comfortable than a real book or trying to hold the iphone .
