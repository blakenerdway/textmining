The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is fine if you like large, impersonal hotels with mediocre service, overcrowded breakfast rooms and don't mind tired decor . Service was a joke , ,  the  evening concierge  doubled as the day doorman and was not very knowledgeable about anything , ,  honestly, the last thing I want to hear when I ask about cool pubs to go to is  why don't you go to the bar in the hotel ? We passed a number of banks on the way up and also a large post office offering currency etc which should give better rates than the hotels in, house money changing service . Finally, the hotel did nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves . because it has sensor to count how many times you open it for beverage service, nice area, near Starbucks, pastry shops, fast foods, supermarket, walking distances to Kensington Palace, London Natural Science Museum, Harrods, Victoria Albert Musuem, pubs, and what else could you ask for .
