'Easy, on, the, eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink : I noticed this almost immediately but thought it was due to my poor eyesight . For those of us in the Boomer bulge whose eyesight is failing and taking with it the pleasure of reading ,  and for those with other forms of visual impairment ,  it's nothing less than a miracle . And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  ! With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes . Now with the Kindle 2, I can change the print to suit my eyes and further, I can make more intelligent choices of books because I have more information of what is available at my finger tips .
