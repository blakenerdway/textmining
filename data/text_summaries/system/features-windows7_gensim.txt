But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment .
These new features make the user experience much more superior than anything Windows has ever offered .
Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .
But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers .
Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features .
I really wanted to like Vista with all it's cool new features, but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didn't work .
