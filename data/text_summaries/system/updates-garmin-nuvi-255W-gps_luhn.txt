> With your savings, you can buy Lifetime map updates from the Garmin web site for $119 ! I ran the updater and there was an upgrade for the software and text for Jack TTS and Samantha TTS . easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map . The sound isn't that bad, Just make sure you get your free map update from the Garmin site within the 60 day time period . Not so ,  tried the Garmin web site for an updated map and was told by Garmin that none was available .
