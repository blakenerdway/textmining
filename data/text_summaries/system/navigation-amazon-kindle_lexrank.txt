Once I got used to it, the navigation was easy too . Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button . 3 Easy page turns and navigation . I find myself reading faster, because the text is more readable for me, and the navigation through the book is so very easy . I found the Kindle Store to be full featured and easy to navigate, and was impressed that you even have the ability to write book reviews directly from the device .
