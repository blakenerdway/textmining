Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .
The difference between the books I've purchased and the price of the Kindle is about $166 .
I would have been glad to have paid any price to have had a book reader that was easier to read for myself with 20 20 vision and especially for the low, vision reader .
since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .
I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .
However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .
But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .
Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .
99, thus offsetting the high price of the Kindle .
I would love a case cover that's well made and doesn't cost a third the price of the device .
