The wine reception is a great idea as it is nice to meet other travellers and great having access to the free Internet access in our room .
That and also the free coffee and tea   every morning were little extras that we felt made you feel like a welcomed guest and that they are going out of their way to make the hotel special .
Coffee and biscotti were available in reception every morning free of charge or if you preferred, there was a restaurant in the hotel that served breakfast or a Starbucks round the corner .
This hotel offers a lot ,  a great location, great staff, free wine tastings and morning coffee .
We did however take advantage of the free coffee and biscotti that was offered every morning in the lobby .
The wine tasting in the afternoon made available from the manager was a really nice touch as was the free tea and coffee in the lobby in the morning which got you off to a great start for the day .
At 5 o'clock every evening in the hotel lobby there is a free wine reception for an hour .
Stayed for two nights and really enjoyed the free wine in the evenings and biscotti and coffee and or wide range of teas in the morning .
Free coffee in the lobby in the mornings is nice .
The coffee and biscotti offered in the morning is a good way to start the day, and the free wine hour from 5 to 6 is very pleasant, although we were so busy we only attended twice .
The free morning coffee and evening wine reception were both good opportunities to meet other guests .
Morning coffee and biscotti was a nice touch as well as the all you can drink free wine hour in the evening .
