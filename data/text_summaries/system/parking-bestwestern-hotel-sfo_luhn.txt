A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area . Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service . When I got a GREAT deal $99 INCLUDING parking ! We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   . all these hotels charge parking fees .
