6, 4, 3 eco engine has poor performance and gas mileage of 22 highway . Engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large person . It fits right , is fun to drive, great stereo, fuel economy, performance . I was looking for a mid size coupe with style, performance and all season traction capability . The car is superb, performance, styling, quality, engineering, fit and finish , the whole banana  !
