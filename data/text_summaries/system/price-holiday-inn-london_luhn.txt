Good pub nearby   with wonderful breakfasts and meals at a good price . Hotel was clean, convenient to tubes, internet cafes, and local dining of all price ranges and styles . Would recommend the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for location, price  , and cleanliness . Excellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum . After initial angst of getting a room, after a NY, London flight, I settled for a twin and not a double bedded room, 17th floor , small but very comfortable room, windows do open, bathroom new , staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !
