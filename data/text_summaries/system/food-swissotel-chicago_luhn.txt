For self catering types, Bockwinkels is a well stocked mini grocery 2 blocks south and 1 block east on street level for snacks, drinks and all kinds of deli prepared foods, plus the Aon Center's underground food court 2 blocks south and 2 . A nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food . We ordered room service for late night ice cream and fruit and also breakfast and it was prompt and very excellent food . Very much enjoyed the Chicago Food Tour, a walking tour that incorporates food tastings at various places like a bakery, traditional deli, pizza, chocolate lounge, etc . Room service was efficient, average priced, and decent food .
