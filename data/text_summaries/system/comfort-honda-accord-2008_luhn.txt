What a car, design, ride, comfort, 270 watt audio system, I love this car . Absolutely got a great car, roomy, comfortable, great ride for a nice price . Solid build, comfortable interior, smooth ride, fuel efficient averaging 27 . This Accord model has a great balance of features that blends attractive styling, driveablity, build quality, economy, and comfort with all the loaded options that I will enjoy over several years and 100000 I wanted a larger car that was comfortable and the redesign of the Accord making it bigger made the difference . Although it's a lower trim level, it has high quality interior trim  very comfortable seats  and and very smooth, quiet ride .
