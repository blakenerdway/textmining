We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive . At the hotel, it is valet only parking . Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service . 00 for valet parking, but that was okay . Hotel parking   is now $23 a night .
