 4 PASS ,  Battery life is amazing, used the laptop in  Super Performance Mode  for over 6 hours of watching videos, checking email, connecting with USB Verizon broadband card, and still had battery life leftover . As for the performance of this little computer, I've gotta tell ya :
 The performance is great for it's size ,  remember these are not designed to be speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time . This did not affect me much, I can write without problems full university texts, media files run without any problem   and the battery have been used for seven consecutive hours using the computer to the maximum in High Performance Mode without depleted . The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   . 0 out of 5 stars Excellant Portability and Performance, August 14, 2009
I'm actually downgrading in performance in getting this netbook but the performance lost is made up with the smaller form factor and greatly increased battery life . I have the following software installed and they work great, modest but tolerable performance reduction :
 No noticeable performance reduction
 Performance reduction here is much less than superpi would suggest .
