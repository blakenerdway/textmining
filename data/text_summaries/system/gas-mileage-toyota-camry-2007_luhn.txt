Ride seems comfortable and gas mileage fairly good averaging 26 city and 30 open road . This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage To top things off, the car gets terrible mileage . Good acceleration for engine size, and good mileage, especially when highway cruising around 70 mph   . Great ride, engine, interior, gas mileage . I have to say the car rode great,comfortable and gas mileage great .
