First of all, the interior has way too many cheap plastic parts like the cheap plastic center piece that houses the clock . New interior is very pleasing to the eye and am happy to have features like tire pressure indicator, side airbags, 4 wheel disc brakes and 16 inch wheels included as standard . Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily . Great ride, engine, interior, gas mileage . Ash leather interior with light yellow fake wood trim is just ok design .
