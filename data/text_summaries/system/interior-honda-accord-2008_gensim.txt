Love the interior and exterior look, the V6 is sensational, and getting compliments on the steel metallic color as if it's a Lexus or BMW .
The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats .
The new body style looks great, and the interior is laid out very well .
The car has a 268 hp engine which provides plenty of power for passing and yet the car gets 31 to 33 mpg the interior of the car is well laid out and the controls and gauges are easy to read and handle the fit and finish of the car is flawless a well built car the exterior design is smooth and flowing well done without excessive curves and as usual the Honda reliability remains its strong point I love driving this car I hate to get out of it at days end this is the first Honda I've purchased ill never drive anything other than a Honda again
The interior design is roomy and very comfortable .
Awesome interior with great comfort .
I am extremely satisfied after the first week  though it was more costly, I still like the smooth power and handling of the V, 6, the comfort of the leather interior, and something new for me .
The interior and exterior look great !
I love the interior layout and comfort .
