The side front windows limit visibility, the transmission hesitates when shifting, the back seat passenger room is spacious, the stereo system has a great bass and the versatility of CD changer, satellite, iPod, etc . I feel the plusses outweigh the negatives, but any prospective buyer should take a serious test drive under varying conditions and actually experience transmission hesitations and the mediocre acceleration performance . Performance stinks due to transmission, always looking for another gear, constantly jerking, dash lights always dimming, lower grill always slipping out . It has been in for a rattling sunroof pan within 1 month of purchase  3 trips for a transmission issue  the radio quit working this summer and needed replaced and now the oil line for the VVTi has ruptured . When approaching a stop with little or no gas pedal pressure, the transmission downshifts normally until the car shifts gears and suddenly lurches ahead at a higher speed .
