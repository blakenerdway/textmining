My father and I were in town for four days from Los Angeles to catch a game at Wrigley Stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services . Instead we were offered a rude and incompetant staff, amateur and slow valet, over, priced internet, garage and fitness room access charges and an inept business office . The several staff folks with whom I interacted were all lovely, including day &amp  night front desk, concierge, doorman, bartenders and restaurant servers . From the moment we checked in, the staff was courteous and meet every need, including arranging for a crib for our daughter and making sure it was safely set up before leaving our room . The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful, switching our room to one with 2 double beds from a king, even suggesting local restaurants to eat at just a short walk away .
