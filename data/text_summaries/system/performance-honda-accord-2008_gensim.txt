Still enjoy interior and exterior styling as well as overall performance and handling .
I researched many other makes and models but for the performance, quality, and style, the accord won hands down for cars under $32,000 .
Lots of power with the 6 spd, and the car has a great balance of style, performance, and   reliability .
The car is great, both with styling and performance .
The car is superb, performance, styling, quality, engineering, fit and finish , the whole banana  !
