The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area . The bad ,  My unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher . Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom . The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models . Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .
