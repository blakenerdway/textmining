The user interface of the 5G Nano remains almost entirely unchanged with the exception of a few new menu items for the video camera, FM radio, and fitness features . video, motion sensing, screen size and sllek look  I recently upgraded from the 2nd generation Nano and love the new features of the newest model . i couldnt think of a single thing  this ipod is reallly great you can shoot videos listen to the radio plus you have 16 gigs of memory it is aweosme i really love it because its still as small as the last one only with a bigger screen and great color The video and external speaker components were a surprise on the 5th Gen iPod . shoes if using vid cam for long time, it kills battery  Standard Def video recording, but still sharp ! Only things I wish they added is measuring distance [not just steps] on the pedometer, better sound on the speaker, and a  capturing still images  with the video recording feature .
