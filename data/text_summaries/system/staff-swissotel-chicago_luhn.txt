The several staff folks with whom I interacted were all lovely, including day &amp  night front desk, concierge, doorman, bartenders and restaurant servers . Efficient &amp  polite staff, exceptionally clean room . Great hotel, wonderful and friendly staff, great location, fantastic view . , staff very slow to offer coffee &amp  clear tables, and the cream on our table was off so had to ask for replacement, but in a nice tranquil setting with a good selection of fruits, cereals, pastries . front desk staff need customer service 101 .
