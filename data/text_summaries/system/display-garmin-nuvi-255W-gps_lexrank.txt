Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed . Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom . The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models . The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area . The unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .
