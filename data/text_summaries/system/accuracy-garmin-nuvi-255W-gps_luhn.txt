I was familiar with the streets and only used the Nuvi to get an accurate arrival time estimate . It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn . What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy . My new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up, Accurate Directions to locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it . I can't believe how accurate and detailed the information estimated time of arrival,speed limits along the way,and detailed map of my route, to name a few .
